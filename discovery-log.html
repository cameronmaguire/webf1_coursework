        <h2>Discovery Log</h2>
        <p>This is my discovery log, however you may notice the missing weeks in the table of contents and that is because those weeks were holidays, week 6 was a consolidation week and week 11 and 12 were the Christmas Holidays. But do not worry if you think I've missed critical time, as I have definitely made it up in the other 14 weeks!</p>
        <h3 id="week-1">Week 1 – Welcome to Web Foundations 1</h3>
        <p>Web Foundations was my very first timetabled university lecture! In my first ever lecture we were given “a very light unit introduction”, which consisted of: who the four lectures and three tutors were, what technical and transferable skills we would acquire on the unit and how we would be assessed throughout the year. Finally, there were some notes about the schedule and etiquette (don’t be late!).</p>
        <p>In my first ever web foundations practical we were given a worksheet titled “Preparation”. In which task 0 instructed me to make the “Discovery Log” (this document, in fact!). I created in a Google Doc which, as Google Doc uses the cloud storage Google Drive, enabled me to work on my Discovery Log from anywhere, provided I had an internet connection. Task 1 introduced us to our personal virtual machine (VM) using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqvC5jOoXQlXggKZkEC025H-N6k7HxdTHpsy0Iylt0c/edit#heading=h.vo6octuf5jte">One Server Per Student basic information for students</a>. One important note about the VM as it is Linux based; when entering a password, no characters appear on screen, not even asterisks! Task 2 explained about the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ChDv3ZRiapnD_2TGNUAS9zjdrl1IdqRAehjBL9fW-A8/edit">WebF1 Coursework 2018-2019</a> that will be issued throughout the year. Next, task 3 was called “Website Awards” where we had to pair up and discuss our choices for the most useful, flawed and utopian website. My choices were as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Useful website - <a href="stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a></p>
                <p>Provides useful and relevant question and answers on almost any computer programming topic and many others too.</p>
            <li>
                <p>Flawed website - <a href="wikipedia.org">wikipedia.org</a></p>
                <p>Wikipedia is fundamentally flawed, because anyone can edit the pages, no matter their knowledge on the subject, which can lead to opinionated and factually inaccurate information.</p>
            <li>
                <p>Utopia website - Hyper-webapp</p>
                <p>Hyper-webapp; one website to rule them all. Essentially have one website with the same capabilities as all the other major websites today. Which would include, but isn't limited to; Google, Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, etc.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Task 4 was to pick an editor, and for me this was an easy choice. I know the lecturers were pushing for us to use Atom. However, second in their recommended list was Brackets, which I used for my Computing course during my sixth form studies. I also learnt that the acronym WYSIWYG means “what you see is what you get” and its used in computing to refer to editors such as Adobe Dreamweaver, which focuses purely on the aesthetic element rather than the coding behind the website. We were told to avoid these WYSIWYG editors. Task 5 informed us about the precedence that we should read around the subject and suggested we read the first chapter of <a href="https://moodle.port.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/991985/mod_resource/content/1/infosec-mgt-principles.pdf">Information Security Management Principles by Tayler, Alexander, Finch and Sutton (2013)</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="week-2">Week 2 – Web Security</h3>
        <p>In my second web lecture, we were told the three principles of cyber security; CIA - which is an acronym for; confidentially, integrity and availability. We were also presented with a security issue called “Social Engineering” (which I decided will become one of my three themes for my literature review). There are several social engineering techniques and they are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phishing, impersonation
            <li>Physical access (tailgating)
            <li>Shoulder surfing
            <li>Dumpster diving, stealing important information
            <li>Fake software, trojans
            <li>Quid pro quo, baiting, pretexting
        </ul>
        <p>Then, in my second practical we were given a worksheet about web security, which informed us that we’d be working in groups, so me and the three others on my table joined up. Next, task 1 was to create a shared Google Doc titled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U8MTE4IM5iDoiObOd6EW_yEO_V4WtX1lfxb4E2Nc3YA/edit">WebF1 Security Policy Task</a>, which was to be used to work collaboratively on our ideas about this week’s task; which task 2 stated was to identify all information that we generate daily from location data to purchasing habits to browsing history. For task 3 and task 4, we simply categorised the information we had generated, in order to make our output from today’s practical more helpful for our literature review, which was essentially task 5. Finally, we were also given a piece of further reading called <a href="https://moodle.port.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/848732/mod_resource/content/1/10_Tracking%20my%20digital%20footprint_FINAL.pdf">Tracking my Digital Footprint</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="week-3">Week 3 – Reviewing Literature</h3>
        <p>In this week’s lecture we were informed what a literature review (not literary review) was and the process for reviewing literature. A literature review is “a formal evaluation of the written academic research on a particular subject”. So, this meant it was not an essay, so review mustn’t include arguments or be opinionated. Instead it should identify what has already been done, the key concepts, patterns and relationships and the different approaches to the topic. Plus, a literature review should be reliable, objective and unbiased. Then, the process for reviewing literature is to first search for quality primary sources using services such as Discovery at the <a href="https://library.port.ac.uk/">University of Portsmouth Library</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/">Google Scholar</a>. Next, you skim read the abstract, then introduction and conclusion and only then if you deem it relevant do you read the paper in its entirety. Furthermore, for guidance on referencing refer to <a href="referencing.port.ac.uk/">Referencing@Portsmouth</a>. We were also given a paper titled <a href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf">How to Read a Paper</a> for further reading. Finally, there was also a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gpLQEWpTVO1L8_zyGe8L01f3iPn7MAJpAOxIwD9JRRk/edit">Literature Review FAQS - 2018</a>.</p>
        <p>For this week’s practical the worksheet was focused on our literature review as from henceforth we could formally begin on our literature review. Task 0 was to read around our literature review title which was “Mitigating Personal Information Exposure On The Web” and record useful search terms. From last week’s lecture I already knew that I’d do research on social engineering, so that was my first search term. Then I remembered from last week’s discussions about how we decided that unencrypted data transmission was a key security issue, so I added that to my list and then this led me to research different types of encryption. Which lead me to find out about homomorphic encryption as a possible solution, so I added that to list too. Later, I stumbled across an excellent phrase the “privacy-personalisation paradox” and with that I had my three themes which set me up perfectly for task 1. Task 1 was to dive deeper into these three themes and find some quality primary sources. Finally, task 2 was to iterate through my list of sources and to evaluate what I had found. At last my literature was taking shape!</p>
        <h3 id="week-4">Week 4 – Academic Writing</h3>
        <p>This week in my Web Foundations 1 Lecture we covered four important points about our literature reviews, because the first submission date was approaching fast. These four points were; voice, guidance, editing and references. About the voice of our literature reviews; we were told that the target audience was not ourselves and that we should cater accordingly using a voice that the audience expects. Next, the guidance about academic writing was that it was to be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Structured
            <li>Objective
            <li>Eloquent
            <li>Concise
            <li>Judicious
        </ul>
        <p>There was further guidance given on what not a literature review was too. For example, being subjective, informatilites, imprecision and contractions to name a few. Then, there was editing which was essentially all about structuring your document correctly and implementing the guidance given previously. "Correct, reorder, restructure, add detail, repeat". Lastly, it was referencing and we were to be using APAv6 and to refer to <a href="http://referencing.port.ac.uk/">Referencing@Portsmouth</a> to help with this. On the final slide we were given a piece of further reading called <a href="https://moodle.port.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/848741/mod_resource/content/1/Academic-writing-style.pdf">Academic writing style</a>.</p>
        <p>This week's worksheet's task 0 told us to make a copy of it, as were going to collaboratively edit it to complete the rest of the other tasks, by restructuring various sentences into a more objective tone. Our work was be viewed here <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCPLyi1v9opVV67saNeFQ4SMbOWUsVZXRffmMx3x9ec/edit">WebF1 Worksheet: Better Writing</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="week-5">Week 5 – Introduction to Markup</h3>
        <p>This week our first submission for our literature review was due, so that took primary importance. However in the lecture, the lecturers ran through this interactive web page about html (hypertext markup language). Heres the document for future reference <a href="http://jacek.soc.port.ac.uk/teaching/2018/webf1/02-html/js/impress-multiscreen-console.html?key=jacek&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjacek.soc.port.ac.uk%2Fteaching%2F2018%2Fwebf1%2F02-html%2F&bundle=left:right&pres#/htmlsummary">WebF1 HTML Lecture</a>.</p>
        <p>This week we began writing in html. For task 0 I created my first web page for web foundations. It was a very simple webpage called index.html and consisted of a doctype, title, h1 and p tag:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>&lsaquo;!doctype html&rsaquo;</code> tag specifies that the document is html5 and is placed at the top of every html document.
            <li>The <code>&lsaquo;title&rsaquo;</code> tag is the title of the webpage which placed in the head of the html and is displayed at the top of the browser window where are the tab names are.
            <li>The <code>&lsaquo;h1&rsaquo; - &lsaquo;h6&rsaquo;</code> tags define the most important heading to the least in descending order.
            <li>The <code>&lsaquo;p&rsaquo;</code> tag defines paragraphs and is used to for bodies of text.
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, in order to display all the tags I had to use <a href="https://text-symbols.com/html/">HTML entity codes of Special Text characters</a>. The remaining tasks were concerning my VM which I had already become quite familiar with as I had been working with my VM for my Introduction to Database Design and Development unit. Therefore, I continued with the tasks and for the final task we were given a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">comprehensive HTML5 element list</a> and we were told to have a read through, which was very useful as I discovered the <code>&lsaquo;code&rsaquo;</code> tag which enabled me to now display the tags with code formatting.</p>
        <h3 id="week-7">Week 7 – Separating Form and Content</h3>
        <p>This week was the first week back from consolidation week and after a few teething errors with the <a href="rdfx.org/">WebF1 Peer Reviews</a> website it was now online, so this week I would complete my ten peer reviews. Anyway the lecture revolved around separating style from content. There are two forms of markup, there's procedural markup which isn't recommended as its hard to understand among other negative reasons. On the other hand, there's descriptive markup which is much preferred as it is a semantic way to writing your markup, which enables other people and interpreters to easily understand the layout of your markup. However, the styling must be written away from your html. For one, have styling embedded in your web page uses more file size and thus costs more money to host as you're using more bandwidth. This was because when you embed styling you have to style each and every element when each element appears in the html. Thus if you had a list you'd have to write and rewrite the styling over and over again for each and every list element. To solve this you can use Cascading Style Sheets or CSS for short. CSS enables you to define rules which style elements directly or via classes and ids, etc. A CSS rule looks like this:</p>
        <code>h1 { background-color: rgb(38, 38, 38); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); }</code>
        <p>Whereby <code>h1</code> is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors">CSS selector</a>, the <code>background-color</code> and <code>color</code> are the properties and the <code>rgb(x, y, z)</code> are the values. Plus, we were given as a <a href="https://portsoc.github.io/style_example/">style_example</a> website with basic CSS rules. Furthermore, can I just say we probably had one of the coolest lectures ever, as the lectures proceded to recreate the <a href="https://portsoc.github.io/episodeiv/">Star Wars Crawl</a> at the start of Episode IV! Here's the <a href="https://github.com/portsoc/episodeiv/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for reference of how it works.</p>
        <p>This week's worksheet concerned style and built upon last week's work whereby the first task was to create a html page similar to last week's, however this week's html included a few new tags:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>&lsaquo;meta&rsaquo;</code> tag  provides data about the document and is placed inside the head of a html document.
            <li>The <code>&lsaquo;article&rsaquo;</code> tag represents an article. The <code>&lsaquo;article&rsaquo;</code> tag is a semantic alternative to the <code>&lsaquo;div&rsaquo;</code> tag, however it can only be used to mark an article.
            <li>The <code>&lsaquo;section&rsaquo;</code> tag is similar in many ways, as it too is a semantic alternative to the <code>&lsaquo;div&rsaquo;</code> tag, but the <code>&lsaquo;section&rsaquo;</code> tag often misleads web developers into deploying the <code>&lsaquo;section&rsaquo;</code> tag as a direct replacement for the <code>&lsaquo;div&rsaquo;</code> tag. Whereas, it is quite on the contrary, as the <code>&lsaquo;section&rsaquo;</code> tag has even more specific usage requirements than the <code>&lsaquo;article&rsaquo;</code> tag, as the <code>&lsaquo;section&rsaquo;</code> tag can only be used as a child of the <code>&lsaquo;article&rsaquo;</code> tag.
        </ul>
        <p>The next task was to style our newly created webpage, however the task suggested using the <code>&lsaquo;style&rsaquo;</code> tag to try it out first. However I knew this to be improper formatting, so I skipped that task and moved on to task 2 which instructed me to now use a linked stylesheet and to do this I had to insert a <code>&lsaquo;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"&rsaquo;</code> tag to my head in order to connect my html page to the css page. Task 3 then introduced class and id selectors, which enabled to style a set or individual elements not purely based on their html tag. Finally, task 4 told us to go out and inspect, investigate and discover greater knowledge about CSS. I chose to have a investigation around one of their recommended links in particular <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> from which I drew much inspiration when creating my own website.</p>
        <h3 id="week-8">Week 8 – Productivity and Efficiency: Editors</h3>
        <p>Week 8 was about the productivity and efficiiency of editors, but mainly it was a showcases all the features of atom. However, my editor of choice; brackets, also shared many of these main points. Thus I was content with sticking with brackets, as ultimately that would be the most productive and efficient editor to use, as I was already comfortable with it and I already knew all the ins and outs of the software. Additionally, this week was the second and final submission of our <a href="literature-review.html#mitigating-personal-information-exposure-on-the-web">literature review</a>.</p>
        <p>During the practical, we were then given some in practical time to experiement with atom's features, so I downloaded <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and gave all six experiments a spin. But ultimately I felt that brackets made me more efficient, so as suggested I went back to brackets. Before next week we told to continue working on our website, work on efficiency and to talk to each other in order to learn from each other.</p>
        <h3 id="week-9">Week 9 – Design</h3>
        <p>Our lecture this week was a thought-provoking presentation about design we were first shown a quote</p>
        <blockquote>"Design is the application of intent - the opposite of happenstance, and an antidote" - Robert L. Peters</blockquote>
        <p>This was used to illustrate to us that design just doesn't appear out of thin air, it takes time and thought to materialise. Next, we were told about a common design pattern called model-view-controller or MVC for short. Which questioned us on our information design; the model and our interactive design; the view and controller. Additionally, we were told about how counterintuitive some hob designs are and a reminder to make our design intuitive. Finally, we were given some general advice and tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand user requirements.
            <li>Understand the user's physical and cognitive abilities.
            <li>Understand what is "good enough" given the constraints.
            <li>Bad design enables human error.
        </ul>
        <blockquote>A designer knows he has achieved perfectiion not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint Exupéry</blockquote>
        <p>In this week's practical session we given a set of cards and told to work in a group of between 3 and 8, so me and my table formed a group. The cards we were given describe "items of information you might have for a holiday resort". So for task 1, we sorted these cards into suitable groups and for task 2 we had to submit a picture of our card sort and here it is:</p>
        <img src="/media/card-sorts.jpg" alt="Picture of cards sorted into groups">
        <p>Lastly, we were given our final set of peer reviews which were due at the end of the week.</p>
        <h3 id="week-10">Week 10 – Using Images</h3>
        <p>This week we covered use of images, pictures and CSS shapes. The lecture consisted of the lecturers going through their pre-prepared website about <a href="https://portsoc.github.io/webf1_img/">Images</a> and demostrating all the features to do with images, etc. For example of feature that was particularly interesting was the <code>&lsaquo;picture&rsaquo;</code> tag, which is used to house a series of images which can be selected by the browser when the appropriate rule is met in order to make my website more responsive.</p>
        <p>So in the practical we were advised to investigate and experiment with the code they had demostrated in the lecture and so I applied the <code>&lsaquo;picture&rsaquo;</code> tag to the image collage on the media page, as I realised when my browser was shrunk down to the size of a phone the detail on the pictures was incredibly difficult to make out, however using the <code>&lsaquo;picture&rsaquo;</code> tag enabled me to rearrange the images in order to get a bigger size for each image in the collage depending on the size of the browser window. (See second example on <a href=#week-16>Week 16</a>).</p>
        <h3 id="week-13">Week 13 – Addressing the Web</h3>
        <p>On our first week back from Christmas we discussed addressing, so here is summary in the form of one long example address with all the element names below:</p>
        <p>https://name:password123@examplehost.com:443/html/index.html?q=query#blah</p>
        <p>scheme://username:password@hostname.domainnameservice:port/folder/filename.filetype?q=querystring#fragment</p>
        <p>One thing to note is that the address is all lower case, has no spaces and you can drop the www.</p>
        <p>The addressing practical's task 0 was create a new folder called links and create a file inside called index.html and insert some provided html to set it up. Then you were to write a list of your favourite website's and here is my results:</p>
        <h4>My Favourite Websites:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>
            <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
            <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a>
        </ul>
        <p>For the final tasks we made some relative links that direted you to other webpages and target and fragments which allowed you to open and link in a new tab, for example, and to scroll to a certain id position in a webpage. In the very final task I discovered a CSS attribute which could be very handy aesthetically with the scrolling to fragments and it is <code>scroll-behavior: smooth;</code>, however this is only partially supported (microsoft browsers: internet explorer and edge don't support it), however for the browsers that do its a nice touch.</p>
        <h3 id="week-14">Week 14 – Website Marking Scheme</h3>
        <p>With our website deadline fast approaching, this week's lecture was about the WebF1 Website Peer Review Guide which came as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_sgXXSa4beKnsj5mHaQTkpZCjH-ubM4bvbdA0VSNZDo/edit">document</a> and a <a href="https://portsoc.github.io/web_criteria/">website</a>. These links were useful, particularly the document as it outlines what the lecturers are looking for in my website submission.</p>
        <p>The practical lead nicely on from the lecture, as it built on what specifically was required, but most importantly the worksheet told us about the automatic <a href="https://validator.w3.org/check/referer">HTML validator</a> and the <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS validator</a> which I placed in the footer of my website. This then alerted me to several errors in my code which have since been fixed.</p>
        <h3 id="week-15">Week 15 – Standards</h3>
        <p>This week we had a lecture on standards. Standards are important, as they provide a level playing field for everyone to use - no matter which company, brand etc their software was. Thus it allows cross-platform communication and so forth. Here is a list of computer-related standards and their documentation for future reference:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">TCP</a>/<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/std/std7.txt">IP</a>
            <li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">HTTP</a>
            <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference_archive.html">PDF</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com">DOC</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HT</a><a href="http://validator.w3.org/">ML</a>

        <h3 id="week-16">Week 16 – Usability</h3>
        <p>In the lecture, we explored why usability is a key concern when designing your website. This included adding features to aid people with disabilities such as colour-blindness and poor eyesight. The lecture went to state how important design was as hard to use websites are ignored, because the user's time is valuable. Thus you need to design your website for the user requirements. Usability is also a science and a cruical part of computer science, the usability engineering process is a circle which constantly rotates thorught design to implementation to evaluation back to design again and so forth. Furthermore, when designing our website we were told to consider Nielsen's Heuristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visibility of system status
            <li>Match between system and the real world
            <li>User control and freedom
            <li>Consistency and standards
            <li>Error prevention
            <li>Recognition rather than recall
            <li>Flexibilty and efficiency of use
            <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design
            <li>Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from error
            <li>Help and documentation
        </ul>
        <p>The lecture finished on a large list of usability mistakes and a link to a set of <a href="https://theuxreview.co.uk/user-research-the-beginners-guide/">Usability Guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>In the practical, task 1 was an architecture sketch, I had already started a rough mock-up of my website, however this practical gave me the chance to refine my designs and make sure that they were usable. So here is a mock-up of my website's design of the homepage for desktop, tablet and phone:</p>
        <picture>
            <source media="(min-width: 70em)" srcset="media/mockups-desktop.png">
            <source media="(min-width: 50em)" srcset="media/mockups-tablet.png">
            <source srcset="media/mockups-phone.png">
            <img src="media/mockups-tablet.png" alt="Website mock-ups of home page for desktop, tablet and phone">
        </picture>
        <p>Task 2 was the usability review, for which I asked my peers their thoughts on my design and overall I'd say it was positive to I continued with my refined design. Lastly, we were told to investigate media queries in order to make our websites responive and adaptive, with a few items of further reading. <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/ux/product-portfolios-61412126">Examples of e-portfolios</a> was an interesting read.</p>
        <h3 id="week-17">Week 17 – Accessibility</h3>
        <blockquote>"The power of the Web is in its unversality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." - Tim Bernes-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web</blockquote>
        <p>That quote gave us a great insight into what this week's lecture would be about, and that is that accessibility enables inclusion for the visual, auditory, mobility and dexterity and cognitively impaired. There were 12 guidelines for ensuring that your website was up to scratch with accessibility and they are the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">WCAG2</a> and here's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">understanding WCAG2</a>. Furthermore, the lecturer talked about accessible rich internet applications or ARIA for short. These are used to indicate to assistive technologies the behaviour of custom controls, for example the <code>&lsaquo;div&rsaquo;</code> and <code>&lsaquo;span&rsaquo;</code> tags.</p>
        <p>In this weeks practical, we were given a variety of tools which enable you to simulate various impairments, which were useful in testing to see if my website was indeed accessible. Plus the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/">Accessibility Guide</a> on the BBC website was very useful. Additionally, we got other students to test our website with various impairments and lastly, we evaluated our own website.</p>
