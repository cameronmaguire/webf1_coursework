        <h2>Mitigating Personal Information Exposure On The Web</h2>
        <p>This literature review examines the personalisation-privacy paradox which arises out of users not wanting to give information away, yet companies tailoring their services to be customisable which leads to this trade-off. This then leads to password security to prevent malicious hands getting to your personal information which is of the utmost importance. Furthermore, the final section investigates the literature associated with unencrypted data transmission, because ultimately without encryption all the above safeguarding steps would be undermined.</p>
        <h3 id="personalisation-privacy-paradox">Personalisation-Privacy Paradox</h3>
        <p>A conflict of interest has occurred on the web in recent years, as companies and other online entities attempt to obtain as much personal information in the pursuit improvements or monetisation of their services <cite><a href="#karwatzki-et-al.,-2017,-pp.-369-400">(Karwatzki et al., 2017, pp. 369-400)</a></cite>, yet web users are also attempting to become more vigilant with their information exposure on the web. This trade-off is commonly referred to as the personalisation-privacy paradox <cite><a href="#weinberger,-&-bouhnik,-2018,-pp.-79-95">(Weinberger, & Bouhnik, 2018, pp. 79-95)</a></cite>.</p>
        <p>There have been several studies examining this trade-off between data exposure and privacy. One theme that has emerged is that users show concern about how much data they may be exposing and thus do want to guard it <cite><a href="#weinberger,-&-bouhnik,-2018,-pp.-79-95">(Weinberger, & Bouhnik, 2018, pp. 79-95)</a></cite>. However, studies then disagree about whether these attitudes expressed here are stood by when the user is actually on the web. Some studies suggest users do indeed keep their guard up over their personal information, even if it may inconvenience them <cite><a href="#lee-&-letho,-2010,-pp.-1-14">(Lee & Letho, 2010, pp. 1-14)</a></cite>. Whereas, other studies proposed there was a miscorrelation instead which suggested users said one thing and then did another, thus they’d voluntarily give up personal data <cite><a href="#gross-&-acquisti,-2005">(Gross & Acquisti, 2005)</a></cite>.</p>
        <p>Further research has determined that users are more likely to give up their more valuable information if they deem there to be a bigger reward or incentive for doing so <cite><a href="#karwatzki-et-al.,-2017,-pp.-369-400">(Karwatzki et al., 2017, pp. 369-400)</a></cite>. But a study by <cite><a href="#sutanto-et-al.,-2013">Sutanto et al. (2013)</a></cite> suggested that there was a limit to the sensitivity of the information that the user would give and this theory was called the Information Boundary Theory (IBT).</p>
        <p>One solution to this paradox is information transparency as proposed in a study by <cite><a href="#awad,-&-krishnan,-2006,-pp.13-28">(Awad, & Krishnan, 2006, pp.13-28)</a></cite>, whereby the user would be more content with information being stored about them as long as they knew it was being stored securely and that they could control it. This seems to have been acted upon in the UK Government’s <cite><a href="#data-protection-act-2018">Data Protection Act 2018</a></cite> which decrees “personal data to processed lawfully and fairly, on the basis of the data subject’s consent”.</p>
        <h3 id="password-security">Password Security</h3>
        <p>For as long as computer security has been an issue; login details, particularly passwords, have been vital to determine the validity of the user in question. However, despite the massive leaps in technological advances over the decades, such as two-step verification, biometrics and advanced card reader systems. There still remains one limiting factor which could potentially cripple computer security; this is, of course, the human aspect <cite><a href="#butler-&-butler,-2018,-pp.-e1-e10">(Butler & Butler, 2018, pp. E1-E10)</a></cite>.</p>
        <p>Many studies have been conducted to attempt to solve this glaring issue, as poor passwords could lead to mass exposure of personal information. For instance, <cite><a href="#mcdowell-et-al.-2013">McDowell et al. (2013)</a></cite> suggested that not sharing passwords would be an effective method to prevent password-protected data from being compromised, but <cite><a href="#zhang-kennedy-et-al.,-2016,-pp.1-10">Zhang-Kennedy et al. (2016,  pp.1-10)</a></cite> thought that wasn’t enough and that users ought to use more complex characters in the passwords in order to make them unique and additionally stated that is was best to regularly change passwords.</p>
        <p><cite><a href="#zhang-kennedy-et-al.,-2016,-pp.1-10">Zhang-Kennedy et al. (2016,  pp.1-10)</a></cite> recommendations on proper password practice are highly regarded as his views are shared with other studies such <cite><a href="#garrison,-2008,-pp.-70-71">Garrison (2008, pp. 70-71)</a></cite> for unique passwords, which means that the user avoids reusing passwords etc. Furthermore, <cite><a href="#adam-&-sasse-1999,-pp.40-46">Adam and Sasse (1999, pp.40-46)</a></cite> also agreed with <cite><a href="#zhang-kennedy-et-al.,-2016,-pp.1-10">Zhang-Kennedy et al. (2016,  pp.1-10)</a></cite> recommendation that regularly changing password is good practice for keeping your accounts secure.</p>
        <h3 id="unencrypted-data-transmission">Unencrypted Data Transmission</h3>
        <p><cite><a href="#chaudhry-et-al.,-2015,-pp.-29-32">Chaudhry et al. (2015, pp. 29-32)</a></cite> states that in the second decade of the 21st century, we are all in a “personal data gold rush”, with online companies pursuing personal data as a revenue source – as well as criminal aspects seeking direct financial gain. The team propose a vital requirement in society for technological mitigations that enable individuals to take active control of the collection, use and consumption of their personal information. In an interview with the British Computer Society, <cite><a href="#simmonds,-2015">Paul Simmonds (2015)</a></cite> CEP of Global Identify Foundations agrees that there are good tools and technologies are needed and are available for data security in the cloud but, he presents his view that ‘you’re never there’ when having to manage data in an environment that is not within your control.</p>
        <p><cite><a href="#dhote-2016,-pp.175-181">Dhote (2016, pp.175-181)</a></cite> highlights the range of the various security issues related to personal data security including privacy, integrity, authentication and confidentiality. <cite><a href="#acquisti-et-al.,-2013,-pp.-249-274">Acquisti et al. (2013, pp. 249-274)</a></cite> give an alternative view that people value the protection of their personal data through considerations of business, law and public policy.</p>
        <p><cite><a href="#chaudhry-et-al.,-2015,-pp.-29-32">Chaudhry et al. (2015, pp. 29-32)</a></cite> proposes the use of a Databox as a mitigation. This is a personal networked device that mediates access to personal data, with the rather grand objective of allowing the user to ‘recover control of their online lives’. The EPSRC Databox project was launched at the IET in London in October 2016, and Horizon Digital Economy Research Group has now developed the first working version of a mini-computer databox for your home <cite><a href="#crabtree-et-al.,-2017,-pp.-1-6">(Crabtree et al., 2017, pp. 1-6)</a></cite>.</p>
        <p><cite><a href="#simmonds,-2015">Simmonds (2015)</a></cite> presents another mitigation through the concept of Homomorphic Encryption, where all computation is carried out on encrypted data in public spaces such that the user’s data is never stored in plaintext. In March 2018 Shai Halevi discussed the progress of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) in an article for IBM <cite><a href="#halevi,-2018">(Halevi, 2018)</a></cite>. He confirms the concept of FHE as allowing encrypted data to be manipulated in its encrypted form without it ever having to exist in a more vulnerable state. However, he does also point out that computing on encrypted data is still up to 10,000 times slower than computation when the data is in ‘clear’ form.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, to successfully mitigate personal information exposure on the web, this review has examined three issues with solutions. Firstly, how the personalisation-privacy paradox entices users to give personal information. However, laws such as the <cite><a href="#data-protection-act-2018">Data Protection Act 2018</a></cite> have helped this situation. Additionally, the significance of password security and encrypted data transmission. Password security can be solidified with proper training and conduct. Finally, cyber-attacks can be prevented with updates and advances in encrypted data transmission.</p>
